  "body": "# About This Project\r\n\r\nThe [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) include a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for U.S. federal government websites.\r\n\r\nThis project is takes the `staging` branch ([link](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/tree/18f-pages-staging))  of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards and alters it so that healthcare professionals can easily use it on their Patient Portal powered by Surescripts LLC's [Patient Portal with Secure Messaging](http://surescripts.com/products-and-services/patient-portal-with-secure-messaging) product.\r\n\r\nIt is a very barebones version of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. We are limited by the CSS selectors that PPSM (our acronym, not SureScripts) supports. For most (almost all) healthcare agencies, their portal is hosted by off-site so they are limited to what they can alter.\r\n\r\nThis is more-or-less a guide to help healthcare professionals theme their installation of PPSM in an accessible and screen reader-friendly manner.\r\n\r\n## Why Use This Project\r\n\r\nThe Draft U.S. Web Design Standards provides an amazing color palette and allows healthcare professionals to roll out accessible web elements to their Secure Messaging and Patient Portal installation.\r\n\r\nThis project was created for use on the [PDR Clinics](http://portal.pdrclinics.com) Patient Portal. Like the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards, this project is licensed under the Public Domain.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThe application of this project to your installation of PPSM includes uploading images, applying CSS in the Appearance area, and hosting fonts off-site someplace. Follow the instructions located in `guides` to begin.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe project can be downloaded as a `.zip` file and then you'll just need to follow the instructions included in the `guides` folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\nppsm-us-design-standards/\r\n├── contents/\r\n│   ├── css/\r\n│   ├── fonts/\r\n│   ├── img/\r\n│   ├── js/\r\n└── guides/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Making Changes and Contributing\r\n\r\nWe tend to update this as changes are made to the `staging` branch of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. The `staging` branch is the bleeding edge of development.\r\n\r\nFor complete instructions on how to contribute code, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n## Contact and Support\r\n\r\nThis project is tailored specifically for a HIPAA-compliant project.
